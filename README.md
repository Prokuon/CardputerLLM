Assembly Complete.

## Additional Notes

To maintain the same thickness as the original Cardputer, the Module LLM header pins will protrude approximately 2.6 mm from the enclosure. For a flush surface, the header pins can be trimmed. Alternatively, deploying the stand will allow the CardputerLLM to sit stably on a desktop.
